For that reason a multi-step account verification process is used to appropriately identify the users. The reason that users are identified is to ensure that the details of the person opening and using an account identify the actual user and that the deposit methods used are not stolen or being used by someone else. This comprises the basic framework for Company's policies against money laundering. The steps outlined below are designed to provide general guidance on how Company will carry out its AML policy by using increasingly detailed information for customer identity verification. Company reserves the right to, based on its sole discretion, escalate the identification requirements by asking for more detailed documents earlier in the process or by asking for additional documents not listed below. The user shall provide all such documents when requested by Company. If the user does not provide all such documents that Company requests, Company may ban, cancel, lock, or otherwise block the user's account until the earlier of the user providing the documents or the Company terminating its relationship with the user. Company puts reasonable measures in place to control and limit ML risk, including dedicating the appropriate means. Company is committed to high standards of anti-money laundering (AML) according to the EU guidelines. Company requires management & employees to enforce these standards in preventing the use of its services for money laundering purposes.",
