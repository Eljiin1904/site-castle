      <h2>Responsible Gambling</h2>
      <p>
        We are here to provide an excellent and enjoyable gambling experience,
        and We provide the means to help you limit your activity on the website
        if you feel that your activity has become problematic. We advise all
        players to take into account the following, and not gamble
        irresponsibly:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Play for entertainment, not to make money.</li>
        <li>Avoid chasing losses.</li>
        <li>
          Establish limits for yourself in both time playing and in money spent.
        </li>
        <li>Do not let gambling interfere with your daily responsibilities.</li>
        <li>
          Do not gamble when you are: stressed; depressed; under too much
          pressure; under the influence of drugs, alcohol, or medication.
        </li>
        <li>Never gamble unless you can cover losses.</li>
        <li>Take breaks.</li>
        <li>
          Have only one Account. Having more than one Account is also a breach
          of Our Terms and Conditions.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        See the below questions. If your answer to the majority of them is
        "YES", we advise you to take action to prevent gambling from negatively
        impacting your life:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Does gambling affect your work?</li>
        <li>Has gambling caused arguments with family/friends?</li>
        <li>Do you always return to win back your losses?</li>
        <li>Have you borrowed money to gamble?</li>
        <li>Do you see gambling as a source of income?</li>
        <li>Do you find it difficult to limit your gambling?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Self Exclusion</h2>
      <p>
        If, at any time, you feel that your gambling has gotten out of control,
        you agree to navigate to the{" "}
        <a href="/account/settings">Account Settings</a> and click{" "}
        <a href="/self-exclude">Self Exclude</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you request Self Exclusion, you will receive an email to confirm.
        When you confirm, your account will be placed on a 24 hour cool down
        immediately. Your account will be put into restricted mode, and you will
        not be able to deposit, play with money, or chat during this 24 hour
        period. You will be permitted to withdraw the value of your account. We
        encourage you to withdraw the total value of your account during the 24
        hour cool down whether or not you have made a decision on an extension.
        At the end of the cool down period, you will receive an email prompting
        you to extend your exclusion. You will automatically be able to play
        again as normal, but you can click the extension in that email at any
        time. The extension periods you may choose from are: one day, one week,
        one month, three months, an indefinite length of time. You must withdraw
        all of the value from your account before selecting any extension
        period, or you forfeit all of your deposits and winnings. Upon selecting
        an extension period, you will be immediately logged out and be unable to
        log back in for the duration of the ban. If you select the indefinite
        period, you will not be permitted to log back in for at least three
        months.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you request Self Exclusion, you will also be removed from the email
        list so that you do not receive promotional materials. You will not
        receive in-app notifications during any cool down or extension period.
