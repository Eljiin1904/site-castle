      <p>
        Introduction: Castle.com (“Company”) is operated by World54 Holdings
        Limited having its office at 2118 Guava Street, Belama Phase 1, Belize
        City, Belize, District of Belize. Company Registration number 000037901.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Objective of the AML Policy: Company seeks to offer the highest security
        to all users and customers. For that reason a multi-step account
        verification process is used to appropriately identify the users. The
        reason that users are identified is to ensure that the details of the
        person opening and using an account identify the actual user and that
        the deposit methods used are not stolen or being used by someone else.
        This comprises the basic framework for Company's policies against money
        laundering. The steps outlined below are designed to provide general
        guidance on how Company will carry out its AML policy by using
        increasingly detailed information for customer identity verification.
        Company reserves the right to, based on its sole discretion, escalate
        the identification requirements by asking for more detailed documents
        earlier in the process or by asking for additional documents not listed
        below. The user shall provide all such documents when requested by
        Company. If the user does not provide all such documents that Company
        requests, Company may ban, cancel, lock, or otherwise block the user's
        account until the earlier of the user providing the documents or the
        Company terminating its relationship with the user. Company puts
        reasonable measures in place to control and limit ML risk, including
        dedicating the appropriate means. Company is committed to high standards
        of anti-money laundering (AML) according to the EU guidelines. Company
        requires management & employees to enforce these standards in preventing
        the use of its services for money laundering purposes.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>The AML program of Castle.com is designed to be compliant with:</p>
      <p>
        EU : "Directive 2015/849 of the European Parliament and of The Council
        of 20 May 2015 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>AML policy changes and implementation requirements</h2>
      <p>
        Each major change of Castle.com AML policy is subject to approval by the
        general management of World54 Holdings Limited and the AMLCO.
      </p>
      <h3>Multi-step Verification</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Step One:</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Every user must provide an email address to open an account. In order to
        deposit or withdraw any funds, every user must verify that email address
        and provide the user's: name, address, occupation, date of birth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every deposit and withdrawal to and from the Company is scanned by the
        Company's choice of analytic service. The service notifies company
        employees of potential risks associated with a user's wallet. Depending
        on the results of those scans, the Company may escalate the verification
        process.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Step Two:</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Company reserves the right to require step two verification for deposits
        and withdrawals for any reason, including but not limited to, the amount
        and size of the deposit, frequency of the deposits, suspicious activity.
        In addition, any user whose crypto wallet triggers Company's blockchain
        analytics service will be required to perform this second step of
        verification. Company may also, at its sole discretion, require any user
        to perform the second step of verification for any reason. Step two
        verification will lead the user through Company's identity verification
        process which may include, but is not limited to, providing Company
        with: a picture of the user's government identification card or its
        equivalent, selfies to be scanned with AI, other similar information.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Step Three:</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        If the previous steps alert Company to additional concerns, or at its
        discretion, the user may be asked to provide additional documentation,
        which includes but is not limited to: a utility bill, proof of the
        source of funds, etc.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Customer identification and verification (KYC) </h2>
      <p>
        The formal identification of customers is a vital element, both for the
        regulations relating to money laundering and for the KYC policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        This identification relies on the following the required steps of
        Company's choice of identity verification service and any additional
        requests made by Company.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Proof of Identification</h2>
      <p>
        Company's identification verification service, as described above, may
        request a photo of a government issued identification document along
        with any combination of handwritten notes, selfies, and randomly
        generated numbers.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Proof of Address</h2>
      <p>
        Proof of address will also be performed through Company's identification
        verification service and may include: different electronic checks;
        manual examination; recent utility bill sent to your registered address,
        issued within the last 3 months; an official document made by the
        government that proves your state of residence.
      </p>
      <p>
        To make the approval process as speedy as possible, please make sure the
        document is sent with a clear resolution where all four corners of the
        document are visible and all text is readable. An employee may do
        additional checks if necessary, based on the situation.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Source of funds</h2>
      <p>
        If a user is required to prove the source of funds, examples of what may
        be required are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ownership of business</li>
        <li>Employment</li>
        <li>Inheritance</li>
        <li>Investment</li>
        <li>Family</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It is critical that the origin and legitimacy of that wealth is clearly
        understood. If this is not possible, an employee may ask for additional
        documents or other proof.
      </p>
      <p>
        Company may also require the user to provide payment through alternative
        means, like by wire or credit, to prove the veracity of the user's
        financial statements.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Risk management</h2>
      <p>
        In addition, Company's identity verification and wallet scanning
        technologies will continue to look for unusual behaviour and alert the
        appropriate employees of Company.
      </p>
      <p>
        While using a risk based approach, manual reviews by Company employees
        may also be utilized.
      </p>
      <h3>Enterprise-wide risk assessment</h3>
      <p>
        As part of its risk-based approach, Company has conducted an AML
        "Enterprise-wide risk assessment" (EWRA) to identify and understand
        risks specific to its business activities. The AML risk policy is
        determined after identifying and documenting the risks inherent to its
        business, such as: the services the website offers; the users to whom
        services are offered; transactions performed by the users; delivery
        channels used by the bank; the geographic locations of the bank's
        operations, its customers, and its transactions; other qualitative and
        emerging risks.
      </p>
      <p>The EWRA is reassessed yearly.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Ongoing transaction monitoring </h2>
      <p>
        AML Compliance ensures that "ongoing transaction monitoring" is
        conducted to detect transactions that are unusual or suspicious compared
        to the customer profile. This transaction monitoring is conducted on
        multiple levels:
      </p>
      <p>1) The first Line of Control:</p>
      <p>
        The provision, by the user, of attestations of name, DOB, location, and
        occupation are the first line of control. Upon deposit or withdrawal,
        crypto wallets are scanned for suspicious activity. Upon the triggering
        of an alert or the deposit/withdrawal of a certain amount of money, more
        information is required. Company als works solely with trusted Payment
        Service Providers who all have effective AML policies in place to
        prevent the large majority of suspicious deposits onto Company's website
        from taking place without proper execution of KYC procedures.
      </p>
      <p>2) The second Line of Control:</p>
      <p>
        Company's continual scanning or all deposits and withdrawals create
        opportunities for Company to address any growing concerns. In the event
        of those concerns, Company uses an identity verification service. By
        using the website, the user agrees to submit to these services. Company
        reserve the right to request any additional information that it, in its
        sole discretion, is necessary or advisable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, all transactions are overseen by employees who are over-watched by
        the AML compliance officer who is over-watched by the general
        management.
      </p>
      <p>
        Specific transactions submitted to the customer support manager,
        possibly through their Compliance Manager, are also subject to due
        diligence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Determination of the unusual nature of one or more transactions
        sometimes depends on a subjective assessment of: employee's knowledge of
        the customer, the financial behavior of the customer, the parties to the
        transaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        These checks will first be done by an automated system, while an
        Employee may manually check for additional security when necessary or
        advisable.
      </p>
      <p>(3) Third line of control:</p>
      <p>
        The transactions observed on customer accounts for which it is difficult
        to gain a proper understanding of the lawful activities and origin of
        funds may be identified as a special risk, must be rapidly considered,
        and additional analysis may be conducted, including manual checks.
      </p>
      <p>
        All Company staff and employees inform the AML division of any
        problematic transactions which they observe.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Reporting of Suspicious transactions</h2>
      <p>
        Reports are made to the appropriate authorities when required by law.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reports of problematic transactions are analysed within the AML team in
        accordance with the internal procedures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Depending on the result of this examination and on the basis of the
        information gathered, the AML team will determine the appropriate FIU
        authority to which a report must be made and whether to terminate its
        relationship with the user.
      </p>
      <h3>Procedures</h3>
      <p>
        The AML rules, including minimum KYC standards, will be translated into
        operational guidance or procedures that are available to Company and its
        employees.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Record keeping</h2>
      <p>
        Records of data obtained for the purpose of identification must be kept
        for at least ten years after the business relationship has ended.
      </p>
      <p>
        Records of all transaction data must be kept for at least ten years
        following the carrying-out of the transactions or the ending of the
        business relationship.
      </p>
      <p>This data will be safely encrypted and stored.</p>
