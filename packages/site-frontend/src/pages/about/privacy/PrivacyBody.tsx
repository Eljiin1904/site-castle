        When accessing our services, we may store information on your device.
        This information is referred to as cookies, which are small text files
        that are stored on your device when you visit online pages that record
        your preferences. We also use Local Shared Objects or "flash cookies".
        "Flash cookies" are similar to browser cookies. They allow us to
        remember things about your visits across our sites. Neither cookies nor
        flash cookies can be used to access or use other information on your
        computer. We only use these methods to track your use of our services.

        Strictly necessary cookies are essential to allow a user to move around
        a website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the
        website or making financial transactions. Without these cookies, we
        would not be able to make our websites work efficiently.

          <strong>A "session-based" cookie:</strong> This type of cookie is only
          allocated to your computer for the duration of your visit to our
          website. A session-based cookie helps you move around our website
          faster, and if you"re a registered customer, it allows us to give you
          information that is more relevant to you. This cookie automatically
          expires when you close your browser.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>A "persistent" cookie:</strong> This type of cookie will
          remain on your computer for a period of time set for each cookie.

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>"Analytical" cookies:</strong> This type of cookie allows us
          to recognize and count the number of visitors to our site and to see
          how visitors use our services. These cookies help us improve the way
          our website works, for example, by ensuring that you find what you are
          looking for easily.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>

        automatically accept cookies, but, if you prefer, you can usually modify
        your browser setting to decline cookies. The Help menu on the menu bar
        of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from
        accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you
        receive a new cookie and how to disable cookies altogether.

        of the interactive features on our sites.
