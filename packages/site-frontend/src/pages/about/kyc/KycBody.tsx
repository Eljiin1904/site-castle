    <h1>KYC Policy</h1>
    <p>Version 1.0.0 - Last updated: 19 July 2024</p>

    <section>
      <p>
        The Company adheres to and complies with "Know your customer"
        principles, which aim to prevent financial crime and money laundering
        through client identification and due diligence.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Company reserves the right, at any time, to ask for any KYC
        documentation it deems necessary to determine the identity and location
        of a user. We reserve the right to restrict the service, payment, or
        withdrawal until identity is sufficiently determined, or for any other
        reason in our sole discretion.
      </p>
      <p>
        We take a risk-based approach and perform strict due diligence checks
        and ongoing monitoring of all clients, customers, and transactions. We
        use a multi-step process of due diligence checks, depending on the risk,
        transaction, and customer type.
      </p>
      <p>
        All customers must verify their email address to open an account. In
        order to deposit, all customers must provide their name, address,
        occupation and date of birth. If customer activity alerts any of our
        monitoring parameters, the customer must complete the activities
        required by our identity verification service. Documents that the
        identity verification service may require include, but are not limited
        to: government issued ID, selfies to be scanned by AI. We may require
        additional documentation for manual review, such as: proof of address,
        which includes but is not limited to, a utility bill; proof of funds,
        which includes but is not limited to, a bank statement or a paycheck.
